Installing and running the application

And let yourself be guided by the instructions of the application.

Two points to take into account
when you search for a book:
-	It is displayed in the search list, 
-	You select it on the closed book logo, 
-	Once this book is select the book logo will be opened and 
-	It shows that the book was already selected and that
-	It is found in my Poch'List, so if you click again on the button in the search list, you cannot add it to the Poch'List list twice, 
-	In this case the action that will take place is the deletion of the book in the Poch'List

Another point: 
-	You can delete the book from the Poch'List list by clicking on the trash logo or deselecting it in the search list by removing the open book logo
-	In this case the logo becomes closed book
